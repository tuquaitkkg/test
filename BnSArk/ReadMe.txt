Install by extracting to anywhere. The launcher will automatically find Client.exe
If the launcher can not find Client.exe, place the launcher into the BnS install folder with Client.exe
Ex. D:\NCSOFT\BnS\bin

Mods:
+ Install mods by placing a folder containing them into the \mods\ folder next to the launcher.
+ Add a "desc.txt" to explain what the mod changes and a "preview.png" to show it visibly.
+ Run the launcher and pull open the Mod Manager window by clicking on "Menu" then "Mods".
+ Any found mods will appear in the checked listbox.
+ Enable mods by click on the check box next to them.

+ Press the "Apply" button to apply the new splash screen.
+ Start the game as normal.
++ Note: Splash Screen replacement is somewhat experimental. All images must be 32-bit Bitmaps (.bmp) The extracted images from the official clients work fine, however a hand made image is not guaranteed to work.
